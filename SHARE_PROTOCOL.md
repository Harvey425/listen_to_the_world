# The Starlight Protocol

> *In the vastness of the digital cosmos, we do not shout raw coordinates. We whisper signals.*

This document describes the **Share Link Protocol** used in *Listen to the World* to transform mundane database UUIDs into elegant, cryptic transmission codes.

## The Philosophy
Raw UUIDs (e.g., `960662d9-0601-11e8-ae97-52543be04c81`) are utilitarian and ugly. They break the immersion of our cyber-minimalist aesthetic. We desire share links that look like intercepted alien transmissions—compact, alphanumeric, and slightly mysterious.

## The Algorithm: "Cosmic Salt"

Our encoding process follows a 3-step pipeline designed for elegance rather than military-grade security.

### 1. Compression
We first strip the hyphens from the standard UUID and treat it as a sequence of 16 raw bytes (128 bits).

### 2. Obfuscation (The XOR Pulse)
To prevent the code from just being a direct Base64 translation, we mix in the essence of our home planet.
We cycle-XOR the byte stream with the key `EARTH` (`0x45, 0x61, 0x72, 0x74, 0x68`).

$$ C_i = B_i \oplus K_{i \mod 5} $$

This light "encryption" ensures that two identical UUIDs generated by different systems would look different in our app, claiming ownership of the signal.

### 3. Transmission (Base64URL)
The salted bytes are then encoded using **Base64URL** (RFC 4648).
-   `+` becomes `-`
-   `/` becomes `_`
-   Padding `=` is removed for minimalism.

## Result
**Input**: `960662d9-0601-11e8-ae97-52543be04c81`  
**Output**: `JzV_QhVCAx0eR3FDPl4cQQ` (Example)

A compact, URL-safe string that carries the coordinate data across the void.
